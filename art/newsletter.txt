Testing! Testing! - 12/19/24

You're probably viewing this through the repository I'm using to test this, but that's okay; I appreciate people digging for cool stuff!

So far, the mods development has been going okay. We're making progress but a lot of it is just me (SquidBowl).. I hope things change later!

This is mainly a test for if things can scroll in the news menu, as that's something I've never really done before... lol. 

The mod should be releasing sometime Spring 2025; Originally I had my birthday or sometime early Winter in mind but ehh things changed.

thanks for reading, good-bye!
